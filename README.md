Missile-Defense
===============

This is my first 2D game I made on my own. It's extremely simple and not a single angle calculation :D

Info:
=====

* Those little gray dudes are called Munchkins. They shoot white lasers at you.
* Those UFO looking things are UFO's. They also shoot white lasers at you.
* Those yellow things coming down from the top are missiles. They are trying to get past you.
* Those red things coming down from the top are extreme missiles, also trying to get past you.
* You are the little blue "shield" at the bottom.

Gameplay:
=========

What to do
----------

1st priority: Block the red and yellow missiles from getting past you.<br/>
2nd priority: Dodge the white lasers getting shot at you.<br/>
3rd priority: Shoot your blue lasers back at the Munchkins and UFO's.<br/>

What you have
-------------

* You start with 30 lives.
* You lose a life every time you fail to block a missile.
* You lose a life every time you fail to dodge a laser.
* You cannot gain lives.
* You get 1 point every time you block a missile.
* You get 2 points every time you hit an enemy.
* You cannot lose points.
* You get 2 shots every time you hit an enemy.
* You get one shot every time you block a missile.
* You lose one shot every time you shoot. (Duh)

Controls:
=========

Use the arrow keys to move left and right.<br/>
Use the spacebar to shoot straight ahead.<br/>

Plans:
======

1. Make missiles move in different directions.
2. Make enemies travel around the screen.
3. Make enemies shoot lasers in certain directions.

Bugs and Glitches:
==================

Ordered by importance:

1. Shooting a laser sometimes passes through the left side of a Munchkin.
2. See the cheats section.

Cheats:
=======

There are 4 cheat codes in the game, but one of them doesn't work.

1. Press n, b, and e on the keyboard at the same time to give yourself 10000 lives.
2. Press h, m, and e on the keyboard at the same time to give yourself 10000 ammo.
3. (This one doesn't yet work) Press l, s and o on the keyboard at the same time to slow down everything but you.
This next one is completely overpowered
4. Press a, l, and p on the keyboard at the sime time to let the game play for you.
#### Concerning cheat codes: ####
Once you use a cheat code, your high score will not be recorded, so be aware.
##### Concerning the autoplay cheat code #####
This one is not completely developed.
###### Autoplay behavior: ######
* The player will teleport to be directly under the nearest missile.
* If the player happens to be under and enemy, they will immediately exhaust all of it's ammo.
